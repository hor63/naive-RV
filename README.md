A RISC-V processor in VHDL

A VHDL fun project. Implement a RISC-V processor in VHDL.
No purpose and intent beyond scratching my itch to learn hardware design in VHDL.

As a side project is setting up a tool chain for that processor. That will be based on the RISC-V toolchain https://github.com/riscv-collab/riscv-gnu-toolchain.git. Changes focus on the linker script and the startup code.
